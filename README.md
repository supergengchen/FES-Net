This project is for '[Fusion-Embedding Siamese Network for Light Field Salient Object Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=6046).' (TMM-2023)

## Saliency Maps

   The code and trained model will come soon.

   All of the results are available on [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rjwN1Fu2NtdFdY1UtmMKxEpRh-oQOKe3/view?usp=sharing) or [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1SltiYfMJDOtetJNmz-VBBQ?pwd=4cjn)

   You can use the toolbox provided by [dpfan](http://dpfan.net/d3netbenchmark/) or [jiwei0921](https://github.com/jiwei0921/Saliency-Evaluation-Toolbox) for evaluation.
